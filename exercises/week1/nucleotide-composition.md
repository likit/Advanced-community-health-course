## Level

* basic

## Prerequisite

* dictionary
* dictionary built-in methods
* iteration

## Skill required

- [X] write a program that reads data from a dictionary
- [X] use a dictionary's built-in methods 

## Problem

1. From the sequence data given below, write a program that prints a chart of nucleotides as shown here. The order does not matter.

```
A: AAAAAAAA
G: GGGGGGGGGGG
T: TTTTT
C: CCCCCC

```

2. Write a program that calculates a percent composition of each nucleotide.

```
A: AAAAAAAA 26.7%
G: GGGGGGGGGGG 36.7%
T: TTTTT 16.7%
C: CCCCCC 20.0%
```

## Data

```Python
sequence = 'AGTGGCCGTGTGAAGAGAGTGCCAACCAGT'

```


# Hints

* You can use a dictionary for storing a count of each nucleotide, where a nucleotide is used as a key.
