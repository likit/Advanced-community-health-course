## Problem

Triglyceride to HDL ratio (triglyceride divided by HDL) has been shown to associated with insulin resistance and heart disease.

|Ratio|Interpretation|
|----|----|
|<2.0|good|
|>=4.0|high risk|

1. write a program that reads data from the given lists and calculate triglyceride:HDL ratio.
2. write a program that creates a list of triglyceride:HDL interpretation.

## Data

```Python

triglycerides = [243, 245, 145, 167, 187, 125]
hdls = [55, 45, 67, 23, 44, 30]

```
